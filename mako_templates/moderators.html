    <span class="about-header">What are moderators?</span><br/>
    Moderators are volunteers responsible for ensuring the integrity of price
    data and controlling user access to ${CONFIG['meta']['site_name']}.
    <br/><br/>
    Moderators will only approve your registration if your in-game name matches
    that with which you registered.

<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">Can I be a moderator?</span><br/>
    As a volunteer role, it carries the burden of responsibility with no real
    reward. The nature of managing a competitive database further requires that
    moderators be professional: anyone selected for this position must be
    someone who can resist the urge to ban another player for undercutting them
    or orchestrating a price-war.

    Please do not inquire about this. If you are suitable, you will be referred.
