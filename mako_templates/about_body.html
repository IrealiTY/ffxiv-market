    <span class="about-header">What is this site?</span><br/>
    ${site['site_name']} is a crowd-sourced database of market board information for
    ${site['game_server']}, freely shared under the belief that knowing market trends
    will help both crafters and gatherers profit, without leading to a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>
    environment.

<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">If it's freely shared, why the authentication?</span><br/>
    The first reason is to prevent data-mining by those who would try to use
    in-game crowd-sourced data for real-world profit. The second is to prevent
    vandalism. Hand-in-hand with the second is the appeal of knowing you're part
    of an elite club.

<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">So how does this system work?</span><br/>
    Simple: pick an item, type a price, and hit update!
    <br/><br/>
    If the item you want to track doesn't exist, just type its name anyway (be
    sure to spell it right, though capitalisation doesn't matter) and when you
    submit a price, it'll be created; there's a field at the top of the page
    specifically for this.
    <br/><br/>
    To add an HQ item variant, just put 'HQ' at the end of its name.
    <br/><br/>
    If you made a mistake when entering a price, just click
    <img src="/static/delete.png"/> on the item page to delete it; if it's the
    only price, the item will be removed, too. You can only delete prices
    entered recently, to preserve historical integrity.
    <br/><br/>
    for convenience, anywhere you see a timestamp attached to an item (the grey
    '8 hours ago' text), you can click on it to expose an update prompt.

<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">What are the key things to keep in mind?</span><br/>
    <ul class="about-list">
        <li>
            Prices should reflect the effective market-floor of an item,
            ignoring obvious outliers<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Outliers are things like items listed at 5g when the market
                    regularly moves at 500g or enormous stacks when people
                    normally only buy singles
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a general rule of thumb, use the price you would have to
                    pay if you were to buy the item in question in reasonable
                    quantities
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use this system to track any items you're interested in, but
            farmable commodities are most preferred, and tracking those will
            help everyone weather (or profit from) spikes
        </li>
        <li>
            While it would be interesting to know the prices of high-value
            items, like housing pieces, you are under no obligation to publish
            anything that you would prefer to keep to yourself, though others
            may contribute it independently
        </li>
        <li>
            Please be respectful of market pricing: don't be the person who
            undercuts a lucrative operation by 50%, especially if you learned of
            it through this site
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">How does authorisation work?</span><br/>
    When you request access, you must provide your character's name on
    ${site['game_server']}. This will create a profile for you with its status set to
    "unconfirmed", and you will get a unique login code, which you should
    record for later use. 
    <br/><br/>
    At this point, you must message a <a href="/users/moderators">moderator</a>
    in-game to be given access; this is to ensure that you are the person who
    requested access, since the names must match.
    <br/><br/>
    At any point, your profile may be banned if you are found to be acting
    against the spirit of this database.
</div>
<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">Something broke or someone's abusing the site</span><br/>
    The site's administrator is ${site['admin_name']}; send a tell in-game or send
    e-mail to ${site['admin_email']}.
    <br/><br/>
    <a href="/users/moderators">Moderators</a> have been appointed and can help with
    cases of price vandalism or fake items, but only the administrator has the
    ability to handle abuse.
</div>
<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">How can I report invalid data?</span><br/>
    If you submitted an incorrect price, just click
    <img src="/static/delete.png"/> to delete it.
    <br/><br/>
    You can only delete your own submissions, though, so
    <img src="/static/delete.png"/> will be replaced with
    <img src="/static/flag.png"/>, which allows you to flag suspicious data for
    moderator review. <img src="/static/flagged.png"/> indicates that the price
    has already been flagged for review.
</div>
<div class="about-topic">
    <span class="about-header">What privacy is provided?</span><br/>
    Your character name is stored as your identification within the server, and
    it is tied to all price-data you submit.
    <br/><br/>
    The password you provide is hashed with a unique-per-user salt, which should
    make it extremely hard to crack, and it is connected only to your in-game
    name, not an e-mail address or account ID. However, no guarantees are made
    about the security of this information.
    <br/><br/>
    Cookies are used solely to retain your logged-in status for convenience.
    Your IP may be recorded as part of routine logging, but it is not tied to
    any other identifying data, beyond fuzzy correlation of access-time with
    price-data.
    <br/><br/>
    This is not a guarantee or commitment to privacy, but the spirit with which
    the system was written is one of analysing market trends purely for the sake
    of fascination, not to exploit its users.
